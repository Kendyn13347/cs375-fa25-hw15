Lab: Implementing and Enhancing Task Schedulers in C++
Overview

This lab focuses on implementing and enhancing 10 CPU scheduling algorithms in C++ to simulate process management in operating systems. You will build schedulers that compute metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, CPU utilization, and display Gantt charts as text-based timelines.

The project develops a deeper understanding of process scheduling, priority handling, and simulation design using data structures like queues, vectors, and priority queues.


Implemented Algorithms

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)

SJF (Shortest Job First)

SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)

Priority Scheduling (with aging enhancement)

Round Robin (RR)

Multilevel Queue Scheduling

Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

Lottery Scheduling

Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)

Earliest Deadline First (EDF)

Each scheduler simulates execution, calculates process metrics, and outputs a text-based Gantt chart.
